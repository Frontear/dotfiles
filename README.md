All of the content in this repository is subject to the GNU AGPL v3 or later.

As an added clause, I'd appreciate any code which is derived from my works and
improves upon my code to be pull requested back onto this repository. This is
not a legally-binding requirement, and as such not an extension of the AGPL, but
something I humbly request as the code author.
