# Information

This folder contains machine-specific configurations, like `hardware-configurations.nix` generated by `nixos-generate-config`, as well as other firmware specific configurations and powerSaving values.

These values are all machine-specific to me, so hardcoded constants are okay. This obviously implies that these configs break when migrating to a new machine, but this is also fine.
